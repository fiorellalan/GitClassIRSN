By Myself!

After four years waiting for it the new album of Florence+The Machine is (almost) here.
Since march 10th I'm spasmodically listening the 3 songs and I love them!!
In her music Florence introjected all the things that she missed during the lockdown : the dance, the crowd, the stage.
I can't wait may 13th to listen the entire album
