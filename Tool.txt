Fear Inoculum is the fifth studio album by American rock band Tool. 
It was released on August 30, 2019, through Tool Dissectional, Volcano Entertainment, and RCA Records. 
It is the band's first album in 13 years, due to creative, personal, and legal issues band members encountered 
since the release of 10,000 Days. It was released to critical acclaim, with reviewers generally agreeing that 
the band had successfully refined their established sound. The album topped the US Billboard 200 chart, 
their third in a row to do so, selling over 270,000 album-equivalent units. 
The album topped five other national album charts in its opening week as well. 
Two songs off the album received Grammy nominations, the first single "Fear Inoculum", 
for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song, and "7empest",[1] for the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance, 
with the latter winning the award.


The album consists of seven main tracks of music, and a run time just short of 80 minutes, the maximum runtime of CDs. 
The digital version of the album contains three short interlude tracks, stemming from Carey's scrapped plan to have the 
album be entirely one long song.[29] Jones and Carey described the songs as lengthy, but containing multiple movements within 
each track.[30] The concept of seven is a recurring theme of the album both musically and conceptually; Chancellor and Jones wrote 
guitar riffs in unusual time signatures related to the number seven, while Keenan introduced ideas related to seven as well.
Music videos also covered the theme.[28] The album also explores the concept of growing "older and wiser".
 Keenan explained that the album covers the idea of "embracing where we are right now, acknowledging where we've 
 come from and some of the things we've gone through."[31] Keenan also advised that patience and multiple listens 
 were required in understanding the album, comparing it to a slowly developing movie.[31] Jones described it as very different 
 from their prior album 10,000 Days.[32] Music critics and journalists have described the album as progressive rock, progressive metal,
  and alternative metal.
